# Operating Systems Assignments for Fall-2019 Offering at Habib University.

The purpose of the course was to introduce students to operating system concepts. The assignments though were more focused on system programming and system calls.

## Assignment 1
The main purpose of the assignment was to introduce us to command line and shell scripting. As part of the assignments we created different shells scripts for different tasks, we also created a tic tac toe in bash.

## Assignment 2
The main purpose of the assignment was to introduce us to system calls. As part of the assignment, we had to create replica of shell, and had to replicate how the original shell creates, destroys and keep track of different processes. The assignment also required us to implement different redirection operation, also replicating how shell runs processes in backgrounds.

## Assignment 3
The main purpose of the assigment was to allow the students to program the memory management concepts. As part of the assignment, we had to create our own implementation of malloc, free, calloc etc, and replicate how the OS manages the memory.

## Assignment 4
The main purpose of the assignment was to introduce the concept of socket programming along with multi threading. As part of the assignment, we created a program for each server and client. The server was setup in such a way that it could connect to multiple clients (through multithreading) and allow the connected clients to chat with eachother.
